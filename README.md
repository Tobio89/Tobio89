#### Front-End Developer at CONUN
It's me, Toby!

I do Front End development at CONUN. I've used React and Next.js to build a bunch of sites and services, and I've even had the pleasure of working on an Electron desktop application and a Google Chrome extension.

Probably the coolest thing I did was set up a deep linking protocol in the Electron application, that works on all three main OS systems.
Or an editable user role and permission system I set up for an internal website.

These days I'm interested in learning a compiled programming language. I've tried C++, Java, and Go.
