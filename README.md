#### Front-End Developer at Lunit
It's me, Toby!

I do Front End development at Lunit. I primarily use React to develop visualisation interfaces for AI-based cancer diagnosis software.
I've worked on building out the team's front end component library, and added a dynamically generated menu component that can even generate its own state and controllers, plugged into Recoil.

At my previous company, I built a cryptocurrency Chrome extension, and developed a way to login to the extension via an external webpage.
I also worked on an Electron application, and set up deep linking for it.

These days I'm learning more about Go. Something about compiled, statically typed languages feels satisfying to program in.
